# Segmenting-Retinal-Blood-Vessels-With-AI
Detection of the retinal fundus vessels.

This project is being developed in order to recognize the vessels of the eye by different methods.

The first method is an algorithmic method that operates on the principle of algorithms and filters, it does not use AI.

The second method is a method using AI.

In the end, we will compare the 2 results and see which method specifically turned out to be more effective in my case.

Method one (colors may vary, but the main thing is the statistics that remain unchanged depending on the color, everyone can choose the color that they like).

As you can see, the results were not perfect, and average 74%. This is the accuracy of vessel recognition in the filtering method.
